This is the JavaScript logger for capturing errors in web browsers and reporting
them to [Logary](https://logary.github.io).

Logary is a free and open source logging framework. It's also a fully functional
JavaScript logging framework which is extremely open to extension, because it's
all composed from pure functions.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install logary --save
```
